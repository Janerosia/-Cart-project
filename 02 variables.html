    //variable is a container that can be used to store a value
    //let creates a new variable 
    //we can save a value inside a variable,the word let is a reserved word which can only be used in this formart(let let 1 or $ or _)
    // semi colon signifies the end of an instruction, their for after any semi colon in a code another code can be writen. eg(console.log(massage); console.log(';');)

        let variable1 = 5;
        console.log(variable1);

  //example 2
        let addition = 4 + 4;
        console.log(addition);
        console.log(addition + 4);


        let result = addition + 2;
        console.log(result);

        let message ='jane';
        console.log(massage);

  // when you need to re-assign a variable...below example

        variable1 = 8;
        console.log(variable1);

  //but the name variables can be reasigned multiple times, example is below
        variable1 = variable1 + 2;
        consolo.log(variable1);

        //other naming tools inclued const, typeof, and var.
        //const is used by defult when the varaibe does not need to be changed.
        //var cannot be used in java script for some resonce but also functions jut like let.
        //typeof help us to check the type of value saved in a variable.
